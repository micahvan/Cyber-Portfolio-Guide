# Cyber-Portfolio-Guide
This spreadsheet template will help manage and guide your professional cyber portfolio. Track Certifications, Courses, CPEs, Memberships, CTFs, Labs, Books, and more. It can also be used to plan future learning goals to promote growth.

The first sheet is a certification tracker. It provides all of the details needed to keep track of your certifications as your cyber career progresses. Further down on this sheet is a section to track and plan for future certifcations, and certification roadmaps from sources such as Paul Jerimy, SANS, CompTIA, and others. The roadmaps can be used to help identify recommended paths of certification as well as certifications that apply to specific domains of cyber.

Next we have the Courses and CPEs sheet. Here you can track courses you would like to take or have already taken. You can also identify how many CPEs you have to allow for proper planning so that you don't need to cram in 30 CPEs a week before your submission deadline.

The third sheet is a place to track the organizations and memberships that you belong to within the cyber community. Some organizations have stricter membership requirements than others, it is best to know and document important dates and costs associated with these organizations prior to joining.

The last sheet concerns good old fashioned books. These can be cyber related or leadership, self-improvement, or even just a good fiction novel. Definitely try to read a good variety of books to continue building a well-rounded mind.
